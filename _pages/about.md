I'm a User Experience Researcher​​ focused on Privacy & Security Issues. 

I am currently an Assistant Professor at the University of California, San Diego and lead the Ujima S&P Research Lab. I received my Ph.D. in Human-Centered Computing at the University of Florida where I was a member of the Florida Institute for Cybersecurity Research and the Human Experience Research Lab. I was advised by Dr.Juan Gilbert and Dr.Patrick Traynor. I also graduated from the University of Dayton with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and a Master's degree in Computer Science from Kentucky State University. ​​​

My research interests include Public Policy, Security Education, Voting Technologies, Cybersecurity, Privacy, Accessibility, and Minorities in STEM. My goal is to improve and alleviate the security and privacy concerns of those most vulnerable.
