   **CSE 227: Graduate Computer Security**
         [*Imani Munyaka,PhD*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~drmunyaka/)

About
==============================================================

This course focuses on computer security, exploring a range of topics – from
systems security, to web security, edge security, and privacy – to illustrate
some of the modern research challenges in the area and the standards for
advancement. It is not designed to be a tutorial course, but rather to give
students the context to understand current security research and evaluate their
interest in the field. The course will examine both the defensive and offensive
side of the field. At the conclusion of the course, the students will have the
foundation to conduct research in computer security and to apply the latest
security research to a particular area of practice.

Evaluation
==============================================================

Since the primary goal of this course is to prepare to you to do research, the
evaluation for this course is simple: (1) class participation and (2)
research project.

Participation (35%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

You are expected to read the assigned paper(s) before each meeting, provide a 1-paragraph write-up, 
and present 1 of the assigned papers. In class we
will discuss the interesting parts of the paper(s). You are expected to do any
background reading on your own and come prepared with questions and an
evaluation of the paper when you are the presenter and when you are not.

Research project (65%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

You will work on projects in groups of 3-5.  The goal of the project is to
conduct original research in security. You are encouraged to come up with your
own project idea, but we have a few ideas that are well-scoped for a quarter
project.

At the end of the quarter, you are expected to turn in a short research paper
(6-10 pages) and give a 7-10 minute talk. We will have periodic status updates
to help you stay on track.

Comprehensive exam (25%)
--------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a MS student taking the comprehensive exam: your project will be
worth 40% (not 65%) and the exam will be worth 25%.

Project ideas
==============================================================

Take a look at [Stefan's list of project
ideas](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu//classes/fa21/cse227-a/projects.html) and [Deian's list] (https://plsyssec.github.io/cse227-spring25/#projectideas). I am a usable privacy and security researcher so the list I am providing below fills this gap with questions to get you started:


- Literature review : I will accept SOK papers in this courses. The requirement here is that you must use some NLP/mixed methods technique to do your analysis. This course is 10 weeks and not nearly enough time to read all the papers.
- Privacy pop-ups and the end user response
- Security anaylsis of the free tools provided to track flights
- How has AI pruvacy notices and terms changed over the last few years? What has impacted them?
- How are gen AI video creaters negotiating privacy?
- How are everyday social media users negotiating privacy in terms of gen AI and their personal image?
- How is open source intelligence used on tik tok? What educational initiatives might support those being found?
- How has gen AI impacted cybercrime? What solutions have prevaled?
- What can we cyber security professionals learn from physical security professionals?
