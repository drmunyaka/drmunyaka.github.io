  **CSE 191/290: AI News**
         [*Imani Munyaka*](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~imunyaka/)

About
==============================================================
This course is a discussion- and presentation-based AI news roundup. Each week, participants take turns presenting and leading discussion on AI-related news, research, tools, or developments they find timely, interesting, and worth examining. The scope of AI is intentionally broad, allowing participants to bring in perspectives from their own disciplines and areas of expertise.

The goal of the course is to help participants become more informed about how AI is shaping both the world and academic research. The class is designed as a supportive space to learn, ask questions, and explore ideas together. Presentations may take the form of news summaries, research discussions, demos, or hands-on workshops. All participants are expected to come prepared to listen actively, engage thoughtfully, and contribute to discussion.
